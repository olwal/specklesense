SpeckleSense: High-Speed Embedded Motion Sensing (software + hardware)
======================
This repository contains software and hardware developed for the [SpeckleSense/SpeckleEye](http://olwal.com/#high-speed_embedded_motion_sensing) research projects at MIT. 

SpeckleSense exploits laser speckle sensing for precise, high-speed, low-latency motion tracking, which can be applied to a wide range of interaction scenarios and devices.
